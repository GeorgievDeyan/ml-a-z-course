# Machine Learning A-Z Course (Python in Data Science)

This repository contains my practical work and exercises from the [Machine Learning A-Z™ course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).

## 📚 Topics Covered So Far:
- Data Preprocessing
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering

## 📁 Structure
Each Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) corresponds to a specific topic or lecture from the course and includes:
- Clean and commented code
- Visualizations
- Explanations and results

## 🚀 What's Next
As I progress through the course, I’ll keep updating this repo. Once I finish the core topics, I plan to:
- Build real-world machine learning projects
- Start creating my own models and datasets
- Share end-to-end ML workflows
